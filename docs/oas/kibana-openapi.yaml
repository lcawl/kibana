      summary: Creates a rule with a randomly generated rule identifier.
      operationId: createRule
      description: >
        To create a rule, you must have `all` privileges for the appropriate
        Kibana features, depending on the `consumer` and `rule_type_id` of the
        rule you're creating. For example, you must have privileges for the
        **Management > Stack rules** feature, **Analytics > Discover** and
        **Machine Learning** features, **Observability** features, or
        **Security** features. If the rule has actions, you must also have
        `read` privileges for the **Management > Actions and Connectors**
        feature. This API supports both key- and token-based authentication. To
        use key-based authentication, create an API key in Kibana and use it in
        the header of the API call. To use token-based authentication, provide a
        username and password; an API key that matches the current privileges of
        the user is created automatically. In both cases, the API key is
        subsequently used for authorization when the rule runs.

        key has different privileges than the key that created or most recently
        updated the rule, the rule behavior might change. Though some properties
        are optional, when you update the rule the existing property values are
        overwritten with default values. Therefore, it is recommended to
        explicitly set all property values.

        API, however, you must still specify all of the connector details.

            hostname to the allowed hosts. You can use a variable to add the
            external system ID to the URL. Due to Mustache template variables

            been placed when REST method runs. Manually ensure that the JSON is
            valid, disregarding the Mustache variables, so the later validation
            will pass.

                    using the same correlation ID are associated with the same
                    ServiceNow incident. This value determines whether a new
                    ServiceNow incident is created or an existing one is
                    updated. Modifying this value is optional; if not modified,
                    the rule ID and alert ID are combined as `{{ruleID}}:{{alert
                    ID}}` to form the correlation ID value in ServiceNow. The
                    maximum character length for this value is 100 characters.
                    NOTE: Using the default configuration of `{{ruleID}}:{{alert
                    ID}}` ensures that ServiceNow creates a separate incident
                    record for every generated alert that uses a unique alert
                    ID. If the rule generates multiple alerts that use the same
                    alert IDs, ServiceNow creates and continually updates a
                    single incident record for the alert.
