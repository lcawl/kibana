= Monitoring the {stack}

[partintro]
--
The {monitor-features} enable you to easily monitor the {stack}
from {kibana-ref}/introduction.html[Kibana].
You can view health and performance data for {es}, {ls}, and {kib} in real
time, as well as analyze past performance.

A monitoring agent runs on each {es}, {kib}, and {ls} instance to collect
and index metrics.

By default, metrics are indexed within the cluster you are monitoring.
Setting up a dedicated monitoring cluster ensures you can access historical
monitoring data even if the cluster you're
monitoring goes down. It also enables you to monitor multiple clusters
from a central location.

When you use a dedicated monitoring cluster, the metrics collected by the
{ls} and {kib} monitoring agents are shipped to the {es}
cluster you're monitoring, which then forwards all of the metrics to
the monitoring cluster.
